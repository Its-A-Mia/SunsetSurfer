# Sunset Surfer
This is a re-imagination of this website, [Checkbox Race](https://checkboxrace.com/). It is built using the React framework. There are some added quality of life features such as storage and display of your best time, a reset button and a beautiful vaporwave scene, but the core concept of the game is still there.

# Project Details

### Why did I build this?

I wanted to learn the fundamentals of JavaSript, CSS, HTML and React. The initial build was almost a 1:1 replica in terms of design, but I revisited this project a year later to finish adding my style, the features I had wished were on the original, and to clean up the code.

### What did I find difficult?

The grid scene is a 3d plane that took numerous tries to get right. The first iterations were mostly static, and looked extremely amateur, but, through much trial and error, I ended up on something I'm quite happy with.

### What did I enjoy the most?

The pursuit of creating a high quality vaporwave scene was extremely motivating to me. Each iteration of each element contiously evoked much satisfaction for me, and once the scene had reached its best form, I spent a while watching it. Seeing something take its form after hours of work is an incredibly rewarding and fun experience.
